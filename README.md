# DriverPass-Project-Design

## Project Overview
The DriverPass project involved working with a client who runs a company helping people pass their driving exams. The client wanted a system that would allow users to register for accounts, schedule driving and written tests, and access online study materials. My task was to gather the system requirements and design a solution that fit those needs.

## What I Did Well
I think I did a solid job interpreting the client’s interview and translating their needs into clear functional and nonfunctional requirements. My diagrams were organized based on user behavior.

## What I Would Improve
If I could revise one part, I would edit the overall visual formatting in my use case diagram. I listed user activities vertically making the diagram thin but excessively long. Improved formatting would have made this easier to read.

## Interpreting User Needs
I broke down the interview responses carefully and turned them into specific features in the system. For example, the need for scheduling appointments led to both a use case and sequence diagram.

## My Approach
I like starting with user goals, then working backward into diagrams. In the future, I’d continue using use case modeling early and keep improving my ability to map user stories into functional features.
