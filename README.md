# DriverPass-Project-Design

## Project Overview
The DriverPass project involved working with a client who runs a company helping people pass their driving exams. The client wanted a system that would allow users to register for accounts, schedule driving and written tests, and access online study materials. My task was to gather the system requirements and design a solution that fit those needs.

## What I Did Well
I think I did a solid job interpreting the client’s interview and translating their needs into clear functional and nonfunctional requirements. My diagrams stayed organized and focused on real user behavior.

## What I Would Improve
If I could revise one part, I would simplify the visual spacing in my diagrams. Some of them were more spread out than needed, and tighter formatting would have made things easier to read.

## Interpreting User Needs
I broke down the interview responses carefully and turned them into specific features in the system. For example, the need for scheduling appointments led to both a use case and sequence diagram. It's critical to consider the user's needs because the system is built for them — not us. If it’s not usable or convenient, the client won’t benefit.

## My Approach
I like starting with user goals, then working backward into diagrams and flows. In the future, I’d continue using use case modeling early and keep improving my ability to map user stories into functional features.
